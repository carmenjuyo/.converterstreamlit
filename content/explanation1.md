### Important.
Because everyone's forecast/ budget file looks different, it is difficult to determine exactly where the segments are.

The reason why you need to put the segments in **chronological order** here is, because the script will look only at the index of the postition
of where the segments are entered here and not the name of the segment..

Soon you will have to map the segments in the **correct order**, but not here, because the script needs to know where the segments are in your forecast/ budget file.

!! If you do **NOT** enter your segments in chronological order (left to right, or top to bottom) here, the data will **not** be correct in the end.
