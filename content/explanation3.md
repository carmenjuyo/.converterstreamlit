Here you can see that in column A, there are minor 2 segments. But the terminology Rms and REV is used 3 times.
So if you want to skip the terminology, you have to click the check box and indicate on which places you want to skip the terminology.

If you want to skip an item, you must write down the index of that item in the correct order that it needs to be skipped. 
This is because the order in which you skip items is important. For example, if you have a list of segments that you need to go through and you want to skip the second item, 
you would need to write down the index "2" to indicate that this is the item you want to skip. This ensures that the system knows which item to skip and in what order to skip it. 
Additionally, it's important to write down the index in the correct order because the system may not be able to understand or process your request if the index is out of order. 
So if you want to skip an item, be sure to write down the correct index in the correct order.

If you already seen the error box, it is good to know that you need to add +1 to the index, as the list is starting from zero (0)
